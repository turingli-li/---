The data has been split into two groups:<br>
* training set(train.csv)<br>
* test set(test.csv)<br>
The training set is been used to build your machine learning model,the ground truth will be provided,you can use the feature engineering to create new features.<br>
The test set is benn used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. we don't provide the ground truth.It is your job to predict the outcomes using the model.
